# Aspirey -  Portable PC from an Old Laptop

This is a small side project where I’m rebuilding an old laptop into a portable desktop-style computer.  
The goal is to reuse working parts instead of throwing them away, add a custom power board, and give it a new look in a 3D printed case.

## Idea

The laptop still worked fine, but the some ports were done.  
So I decided to keep the motherboard, RAM, and SSD and screen , and build everything into a small case with better cooling and easier access to ports.
