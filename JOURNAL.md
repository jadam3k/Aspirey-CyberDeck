## 11/10/2025 5 PM - Getting Started: From Old Laptop to Cyberdeck  



## The Idea
Since I wanted to do something creative with my old laptop that was no longer working, I decided to turn it into a **programming cyberdeck**.  

I’m thinking of using a **sliding keyboard** that will come out from under the screen, which originally belonged to my laptop. This way, the cyberdeck stays compact but still fully functional.

## Early Assessment and Setbacks
At this stage, I carefully looked over my laptop to see what needed fixing. While testing, I accidentally connected the LVDS input to an Diode, which caused short circuit.  

As a result, I’ll need to **make a PCB** to handle the **HDMI to LVDS conversion**. It’s a small setback, but it’s all part of the learning process, and now I know exactly what needs to be done next.


LOL:

Connecting and Testing

During this stage, I started **connecting and testing** the components. Luckily, the earlier short circuit didn’t cause any major problems. However, I discovered that the **LVDS input was damaged**, which caused the screen to flicker and display a white image.  

I thought Windows would still work, but it immediately showed a **blue screen**.  

I also started taking apart another laptop for reference. It turned out to be **20 years old**, and its motherboard was **four times thicker** than the one in my laptop I’m converting 💀.  

This stage took **about 7 hours**, but unfortunately, it didn’t bring any usable results. It was frustrating, but part of the learning process.

## 11/10/2025 6:06 PM - Installing Linux  

Since Windows wasn’t working, I had to **install Linux**. The first challenge was that the **HDMI port didn’t work**, so I had to solder it using an old soldering iron because my new one hadn’t arrived yet (still waiting on it from the Blueprint program lol).  

I decided to go with **Linux Mint**. There were a few minor issues with the disk as well, but in the end, everything worked out.  

The whole process took about **2.5 hours**, and now the system is up and running smoothly.
